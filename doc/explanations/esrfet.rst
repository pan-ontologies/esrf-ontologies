Ontological Definition of Experimental Techniques
=================================================

In the :ref:`ESRFET <techniques>` ontology, each experimental technique is defined through semantic definitions
â€” precise, formal descriptions of their essential features expressed in a structured language that both humans
and computers can understand.

Semantic definitions specify *what* a technique measures, *what* inputs it requires, and *how* the measurement
is performed by formally encoding these characteristics using logic-based languages such as OWL. This approach
ensures unambiguous and machine-interpretable representations.

Key elements commonly captured in these semantic definitions include:

- The physical interaction underlying the technique (e.g., diffraction, fluorescence)
- The specific properties measured (e.g., energy, intensity)
- The nature of the input required (e.g., X-rays, electrons)
- The type of detector or measurement method employed (e.g., energy-dispersive detector)

Using semantic definitions enables advanced functionalities such as:

- Precise searching for techniques based on detailed criteria
- Automated classification, comparison, and reasoning about experimental methods

Moreover, semantic definitions facilitate consistent and extensible integration of new techniques
by describing their defining properties within this formal, computer-readable framework, enhancing
interoperability and discoverability across scientific research.
