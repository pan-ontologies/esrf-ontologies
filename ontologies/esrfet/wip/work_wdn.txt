To DISCUSS:
-----------

1. some standard ranges need to exist like in the case of atomic_distance_range(?).
   We need to name them and keep them as classes? If there are certain discrete bounds
   we need to keep them with a name as classes and define them according to the value 
   of the data-property. 
   If we need a free given value we need it to be a data-property in a class as well.
   Same for: energy_range, atomic_distance_resolution, sample_spatial_resolution 

TODO:
-----

1. Put the current building blocks in protege
2. Define several PaNET and new ESRF techniques based on thse building blocks
3. ISDD presentation on the 21th (ask for EXP volunteers) -> define their techniques + add more building blocks

Ontology usage:
---------------

- Question Type 1: 
  I want to find out which pigments the painter used in this painting. Which technique can I use for that?
  I want to use X-ray powder diffraction to find out which pigments the painter used in this painting. Would this work and if yes, what are the limitations.

- Question Type 2:
  Am I using the same technique as in this particular scientific publication?

- Question Type 3:
  I want to use a specific technique (e.g. derived from question type 1). Where do I go for that?

- Question Type 4:
  I want to use a specific technique (e.g. derived from question type 1). Who do I contact to know whether this is the right thing to do for my particular use case?

- Question Type 5:
  Give me a list of non-existing techniques that could solve new scientific problems.

- Question Type 6:
  How are X-ray powder diffraction and X-ray absorption spectroscopy related? What is the overlap and the differences in terms of characteristics?
  How are X-ray powder diffraction and X-ray absorption spectroscopy related? What is the overlap and the differences in terms of scientic problems they can solve?

Ontology design principles:
---------------------------

- Deferential definition of techniques:
Suppose technique1 = block1 AND block2. Now we create a new technique technique2 = block1 AND block2 AND block3
but it is not a specialization of technique1. This means we need to re-define technique1 = block1 AND block2 AND block4.

- Define classes and let the tree structure be infered instead of creating a taxonomy only structure like PaNET:
technique1 = block1 AND block2 defines the technique using other classes and inheritance or better object and data properties.

- insert individuals for each leaf-class to let the reasoner find inconcistencies.

- Every thechnique has a list of labels and two of them are necessary and special: the default short name
(technique accronym) and the default long name (full technique name) for human concumption. For APIs all
labels are equal.

Adding technique:

- "Name" when creating a new technique class (used only for the IRI): XAS
- Add "Annotation" "rdfs:label" (used for display in protege and default long name?): XAS
- Add "Annotation" "skos:prefLabel" (default long name?): X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy
- Add "Annotation" "skos:altLabel" (add short or long names to the list of technique labels): ... 
- "Equivalent To" (): logical operators to combine classes and data property

object properties connect classes


ISDD Presentation OSCAR:
------------------------

- Problem we focus on the ultimate goal and as a result we get nothing done.
- Ultimate goal: "data speaks for itself" which means
                 in HDF5: contains meaning in the context of a technique for data processing
                 in ICAT: search
- Solution: NeXus
- Proposal: Start with the context
- Define techniques:
           - Taxonomies (flat list of names): show Giannis google doc (Renauld)
           - Ontologies (define techniques based on hpw they are related to eachother):
                - subsclassing: PANET
                - composition: like LEGO
- Freedom to define new techniques and blocks as we go
- How can I bother with it? In preparation for the OSCAR 

- OSCAR: create a process on how each institute can define its own ontology and connect/influence a central ontology (PANET).
         Common vocab. and common understanding when discussing techniques.


Technique Characteristics:
--------------------------

When X-rays or electrons interact with matter (for example atoms bound in molecules or crystals) a cascade of several events could occur, each of them
having a different probability to occur. Since you have many atoms, all possible events are happening at the same time. Depending on the detection types
you use, you can only see a subset of all the possible events, often only one specific cascade of events.

An example of a cascade of events: X-ray photon energy is transferred to an inner core electron of an atom (atomic core excitation). The atom that is left
after this is in a unstable state and naturally reverts to its ground state by an electron falling back from a higher energy level and the energy is
release in one of these forms: as an X-ray (fluorescence), as an electron from a higher energy level (Auger). So there are two event cascades described here
which could be called fluorescence and Auger. You can detect fluorescence, Auger or both.

"sample-input": the thing that leads to the cascade of events
"interaction": is the first step of a cascade
"detection": selection of cascades you measure

For example "atomic core excitation" are all the events cascades that result from atomic core excitation.



"sample-input" and "detection" can have characteristics.

If "sample-input" are X-rays, the X-rays have characteristics. They have a energy distribution that could change in space and time.
The energy distribution can be narrow (monochromatic in which case it has an energy, e.g. 10 keV),
wide (pink) or very wide (white). X-rays also have a spatial distribution: parallel and not parallel.
When parallel it can have a diameter which is in the nano, micro etc. length scale. 

If "detection" is transmission, it can be a diode or a full-field camera (point or image). If "detection" is fluorescence, it has
an energy resolution (smallest difference on photon energy that can be distinguished) and a range (e.g. >= 1 keV)

Source, sample and detector can move during the measurement: images, tomography, ...

How to use the NeXus Ontology:
------------------------------

Data analysis software needs to know:

- Can I calculate elemental concentrations from this data?
- What can I calculate from this data?


https://manual.nexusformat.org/classes/applications/NXfluo.html

Group "/entry/instrument/fluorescence" is related to these building blocks:
- detect_photon_energy
- fluorescence

Dataset "/entry/instrument/source/probe" is related to these building blocks:
- x-ray

How to deal with technique purpose:
-----------------------------------

Combine our building blocks to create scientific purposes (3D elemental concentrations, Protein structures, Residual stress, ...).

Then we can ask the ontology:
    - What is the purpose of XRF?
    - What techniques provide elemental concentrations?

If you cannot derive purpose from the building blocks, you are missing building blocks.

The building blocks you need for purpose may be more than the building blocks you need just for differentiating techniques.
