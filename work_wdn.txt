Ontology design principles:
---------------------------

Suppose technique1 = block1 AND block2. Now we create a new technique technique2 = block1 AND block2 AND block3
but it is not a specialization of technique1. This means we need to re-define technique1 = block1 AND block2 AND block4.

Technique Characteristics:
--------------------------

When X-rays or electrons interact with matter (for example atoms bound in molecules or crystals) a cascade of several events could occur, each of them
having a different probability to occur. Since you have many atoms, all possible events are happening at the same time. Depending on the detection types
you use, you can only see a subset of all the possible events, often only one specific cascade of events.

An example of a cascade of events: X-ray photon energy is transferred to an inner core electron of an atom (atomic core excitation). The atom that is left
after this is in a unstable state and naturally reverts to its ground state by an electron falling back from a higher energy level and the energy is
release in one of these forms: as an X-ray (fluorescence), as an electron from a higher energy level (Auger). So there are two event cascades described here
which could be called fluorescence and Auger. You can detect fluorescence, Auger or both.

"sample-input": the thing that leads to the cascade of events
"interaction": is the first step of a cascade
"detection": selection of cascades you measure

For example "atomic core excitation" are all the events cascades that result from atomic core excitation.



"sample-input" and "detection" can have characteristics.

If "sample-input" are X-rays, the X-rays have characteristics. They have a energy distribution that could change in space and time.
The energy distribution can be narrow (monochromatic in which case it has an energy, e.g. 10 keV),
wide (pink) or very wide (white). X-rays also have a spatial distribution: parallel and not parallel.
When parallel it can have a diameter which is in the nano, micro etc. length scale. 

If "detection" is transmission, it can be a diode or a full-field camera (point or image). If "detection" is fluorescence, it has
an energy resolution (smallest difference on photon energy that can be distinguished) and a range (e.g. >= 1 keV)

Source, sample and detector can move during the measurement: images, tomography, ...
